    Often when talking about Polymorphism in Java people are referring to the ability for a
    method to take on many forms. There are two primary ways this happens
    - Overriding: This is run-time polymorphism where the implementation is determined by the
                  type of the object calling the method
    - Overloading: This is compile-time polymorphism where methods can share a name but have
                   differing implementations

        no args constructor that only creates an object, the other will still create our
        object but will also print a message of our choice to the terminal. This is an example
        of overloading: one method can change its parameters to change the implementation
     */
